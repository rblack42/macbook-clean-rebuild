This project documents the process I use to rebuild my development Mac systems.
As a Computer Science Professor, I rebuilt my teaching machines at the end of
each term so I started off with a clean machine with just the tools I needed to
use that term. 

The machines I rebuild using the process detailed here include:

* iMac 5k (2013)
* Macbook Air (2017)
* Macbook Pro (2016)
* Macbooc M1 Air (2020)
* Macbook Pro M1-Max (2022)

All of these machines are currently running MacOS 12.6 (Monterey)

The inotes presented here were developed using Jupyter Notebook. The
documentation found at the link above is a static version of those notebook
pages produced using *Jupyter Book*.
